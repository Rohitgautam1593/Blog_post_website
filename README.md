The error `Fatal error: Uncaught PDOException: could not find driver` means the **PDO MySQL extension is still not enabled** in your PHP configuration.

This is a PHP setup issue, not a code issue.  
**No code or command I run here can fix it until you enable the extension in your local PHP installation.**

## **How to Fix (Step-by-Step, Please Follow Exactly):**

1. **Find your PHP installation folder**  
   (e.g., `C:\php` or `C:\Program Files\php`)

2. **Open `php.ini` in a text editor**  
   - If you donâ€™t see `php.ini`, copy `php.ini-development` or `php.ini-production` to `php.ini` and edit that.

3. **Search for this line:**  
   ```
   ;extension=pdo_mysql
   ```
   - Remove the `;` at the start so it becomes:
   ```
   extension=pdo_mysql
   ```

4. **Save the file.**

5. **Restart your PHP server:**  
   - Stop the running PHP server (press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal).
   - Start it again:
     ```
     php -S localhost:8000
     ```

### **Verify the Fix**

1. Create a file called `phpinfo.php` in your project directory with this content:
   ```php
   <?php phpinfo();
   ```
2. Visit `http://localhost:8000/phpinfo.php` in your browser.
3. Search for `pdo_mysql` in the output.  
   - If you see it, the extension is enabled.
   - If not, the extension is still not enabled.
